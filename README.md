Each player in turn flips two cards. If these two cards are identical, this player earn a point. 
Number of turnes (moves) are counted for each player.

After all cards are open - the player with more points is the winner. if there is a draw, the points are split between the players (each player get half of point for wins and half of point to loses).

In the top menu bar we have 3 options :
1) Log out
